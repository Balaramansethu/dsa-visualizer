Interactive Algorithm Visualizer Using ReactJS & ThreeJS
Overview
The Interactive Algorithm Visualizer is an innovative tool designed to help users understand complex algorithms through visual, interactive representations. Built with ReactJS for a responsive interface and ThreeJS for 3D visualizations, this tool offers a unique and engaging way to explore and learn various data structures and algorithms.

Key Features
Data Structure Visualizations:
Supports a range of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
Users can see how data is stored, manipulated, and accessed within these structures.
Step-by-Step Algorithm Execution:
Demonstrates the working of algorithms like sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort), searching (e.g., Binary Search), and graph traversal (e.g., BFS, DFS) with step-by-step execution.
Users can watch each operation as it happens, making it easier to grasp the logic.
Interactive User Controls:
Allows users to adjust the speed of visualizations, pause, play, and step through each operation.
Users can input their data to see how algorithms handle different scenarios.
Educational Tool:
Ideal for students and educators, this visualizer makes learning algorithms more engaging and less abstract.
Provides a hands-on experience that enhances understanding.
Technologies Used
ReactJS: For creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
ThreeJS: For 3D visualizations that bring algorithms to life.
JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Core web technologies for development.

Usage
Use the menu to select the data structure or algorithm you want to visualize.
Adjust settings like speed or input data using the controls.
Play, pause, or step through the algorithm to observe each stage.
